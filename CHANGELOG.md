# [5.0.0](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v4.0.0...v5.0.0) (2021-03-07)

This is a major overhaul of the library to allow for support for webhid to be added cleanly.
The major changes are listed below, and should be reviewed when updating.

The most notable changes are the api now returns promises for every operation, and various methods have been renamed to be more consistent

### Features
* convert most methods to return promises, as webhid uses them even though node-hid doesnt. ([7b1883b](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/7b1883be9ff91293aeef95cd1c0f087d795a4fb1))

## [2.1.1](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) (2018-04-05)

### Bug Fixes

-   **package:** pin node-hid to 0.6.0 ([de5186a](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/de5186a)), closes [#46](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/issues/46)

<a name="2.1.0"></a>

# [2.1.0](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0) (2018-03-05)

### Features

-   **package:** eliminate the need for compilation of dependencies on most platforms ([9e5f338](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/9e5f338))

<a name="2.0.0"></a>

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2017-11-28)

### Features

-   add `fillPanel` method
-   add `clearAllKeys` method
-   return the `StreamDeck` constructor instead of automatically instantiating it
-   allow providing a `devicePath` to the constructor
    -   if no device path is provided, will attempt to use the first found Stream Deck. Errors if no Stream Decks are connected.
-   update `this.keyState` _before_ emitting `down` and `up` events
    -   this is technically a _breaking change_, but is very unlikely to affect any production code

### Bug Fixes

-   fix center-cropping in `fillImageFromFile`
-   fix `sharp` only being a `devDependency`, and not a production `dependency`

### Code Refactoring

-   refactor `StreamDeck` class to move as much as possible to static methods and static getters
-   refactor code to use `async`/`await`
    -   this is a _breaking change_, because we now only support Node.js v7.6 or newer

### Documentation

-   update all examples
-   add `fillPanel` example

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   `this.keyState` is now updated **before** `down` and `up` events are emitted.
-   Support for versions of Node.js earlier than 7.6 has been dropped.
-   The `StreamDeck` constructor is now required when `require`ing this library, instead of an instance of the class. \* See the docs for updated examples.
