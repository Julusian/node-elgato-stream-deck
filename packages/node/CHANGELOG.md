# [5.0.0](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v4.0.0...v5.0.0) (2021-03-07)

This is a major overhaul of [elgato-stream-deck](https://npmjs.com/package/elgato-stream-deck) to allow for support for webhid to be added cleanly.
The major changes are listed below, and should be reviewed when updating.

The most notable changes are the api now returns promises for every operation, and various methods have been renamed to be more consistent

### Features
* convert most methods to return promises, as webhid uses them even though node-hid doesnt. ([7b1883b](https://github.com/julusian/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/7b1883be9ff91293aeef95cd1c0f087d795a4fb1))
